## Usage

1. Launch the app on your iOS device or simulator.
2. Play the game by swiping in any direction (up, down, left, or right).
3. Combine matching tiles to create higher-numbered tiles, aiming for the 2048 tile.
4. The game ends when there are no more valid moves, resulting in a loss.
5. Enjoy smooth animations for tile movement and merging.
